## git

git is a version-control tool, typically used at the commandline. It's almost like a programming language, except it only does one thing (track changes to work). 

It allows you to "commit" changes to work, and associate descriptive messages with those stages of your work. 

There are other version control systems (most notably svn) but we're talking about git here because it works well with...

## GitHub

GitHub is a website where you can share code with people on the internet. It is closely coupled with git, but you can use git without GitHub, and vice versa.

## What we're doing this morning 

A high-level overview (I'll get more specific in a minute)

1. Make sure everything is set up on your computer
2. Fork a GitHub repository (Jenny Bryan's [bingo R package](https://github.com/jennybc/bingo))
3. Clone it to your computer
4. Build the package locally 
5. Make changes 
6. Ensure the package still builds
7. Commit changes
8. Push changes to your fork of the repo
9. Submit a pull request

---

## Making sure everything is set up

In your RStudio, you should have a pane that has at least two tabs, one labeled Console and the other Terminal. The Console is just for `R` code, and the `Terminal` is more general, for commandline tools. 

Let's first make sure you have the `usethis` package. In your Console, type 

```{r}
library(usethis)
```

If you get an error, install the `usethis` package,

```{r}
install.packages("usethis")
```

Then, let's check you have git. Open the Terminal tab and type 

```
git --version
```

If nothing comes up, talk to one of us about getting up to speed! Assuming you get something back, then try 

```
git config --global --list
```

and ensure it at least knows your `user.name` and `user.email`. If one or both of those things are missing, flag one of us, and/or follow the [Happy git with R advice](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html).

## Fork and clone a repo

**Forking** a GitHub repository is essentially making your own copy of the code as it stands right now.

## Fork and clone a repo
**Cloning** is getting the files onto your own computer

## Fork and clone a repo

There are several different ways to fork and clone a repo. We'll be following the `usethis` way, using the `create_from_github()` function. This does all the work for us! Run this code in your Console and watch what prints. 

```{r create}
create_from_github("jennybc/bingo", protocol = "https")
```

---

## The bingo package

You should now have a new RStudio project open, containing the code from the `bingo` package.

## The bingo package

You can also go on GitHub to view Jenny Bryan's version of the code, at [https://github.com/jennybc/bingo](https://github.com/jennybc/bingo) and *your* version of the code, at `https://github.com/[whatever your GitHub username is]/bingo`. For example, mine is at [https://github.com/AmeliaMN/bingo](https://github.com/AmeliaMN/bingo)
