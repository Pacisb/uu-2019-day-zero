## git

git is a version-control tool, typically used at the commandline. It's almost like a programming language, except it only does one thing (track changes to work). 

It allows you to "commit" changes to work, and associate descriptive messages with those stages of your work. 

There are other version control systems (most notably svn) but we're talking about git here because it works well with...

## GitHub

GitHub is a website where you can share code with people on the internet. It is closely coupled with git, but you can use git without GitHub, and vice versa.

## What we're doing this morning 

A high-level overview (I'll get more specific in a minute)

1. Make sure everything is set up with your git
2. Fork a GitHub repository (Jenny Bryan's [bingo R package](https://github.com/jennybc/bingo))
3. Clone it to your computer
4. Build the package locally 
5. Make changes 
6. Ensure the package still builds
7. Commit changes
8. Push changes to your fork of the repo
9. Submit a pull request

## Making sure everything is set up

In your RStudio, you should have a pane that has at least two tabs, one labeled Console and the other Terminal. The Console is just for `R` code, but the `Terminal` is more general, for commandline tools. To check you have git, open the Terminal tab and type 

```
git --version
```

If nothing comes up, talk to one of us about getting up to speed! Assuming you get something like

```
git version 2.10.1 (Apple Git-78)
```

then try 

```
git config --global --list
```

and ensure it at least knows your `user.name` and `user.email`
