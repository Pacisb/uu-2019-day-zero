# HTML - CSS - JS

I'm going to give a crash course to those who are not familiar with HTML/CSS/JS. I'm not a professional web developer, but I guess I know enough basics. This will only be a very casual tutorial, and I don't have time to prepare slides for you (apologies!), but below is an outline:

- The minimal tutorial: <https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/website-basics.html>
- HTML: <https://www.w3schools.com/html/>
- CSS: <https://www.w3schools.com/css/>
- JavaScript: <https://www.w3schools.com/js/>
- Some examples and applications
