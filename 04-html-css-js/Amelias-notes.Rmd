Yihui said he wasn't going to use slides, but do some live-coding. I decided to take some notes here and commit them to the day 0 repo so they would be available. 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Usually, I would make an html file using SublimeText2, but Yihui showed a way to use an R function to create and open a new HTML document!

```{r}
file.edit("test.html")
```

You can serve the file using the `servr` package. 

```{r}
servr::httw()
```

If you navigate to `test.html` in your Viewer, you can add code to the file, save, and see it immediately reflected in the served version. 

We started with a text file, which didn't have any tags. But now we're going to start making it more like a real HTML file.
