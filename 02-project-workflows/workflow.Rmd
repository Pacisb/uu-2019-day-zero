# Saving source & blank slates 

---
## Save the source, not the workspace

Attachment to your workspace indicates that you have a **non-reproducible** workflow. 

Any individual R process and the associated workspace is disposable.

#### Everything that really matters should be achieved through code that you save.

???
Saving code – not workspaces – is incredibly important because it is an absolute requirement for reproducibility. 
---
## Use an IDE

An [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (IDE) makes it much easier to follow best practices.


Popular IDEs:  
- RStudio  
- Emacs + ESS  
- vim + Nvim-R  
- Visual Studio + RTVS


<br />
#### This eliminates the temptation to develop code directly in the R Console. 

**Direction of causality**: long-time coders don’t organize their work into self-contained projects and use relative paths because they use an IDE. They use an IDE because it makes it easier to follow standard practices, such as these.

(More on this to come)

???
best practices = develop reproducible code in a .R or .Rmd file

---
## Always start R with a blank slate

.pull-left[
#### The rules:
When you quit R, do not save the workspace to an `.Rdata` file.  

When you launch, do not reload the workspace from an `.Rdata` file.

#### How to enforce them:

In RStudio, set this via *Tools* > *Global Options*

`usethis::use_blank_slate()` prints a reminder about how to do this.

## Restart R often

.pull-left[
<img src="img/on-and-off-rect.png" height="400px"/>
]
.pull-right[
#### To restart:
In RStudio, menu item *Session* > *Restart R*

Keyboard shortcut: [Ctrl/Command] + Shift + F10 

#### To say "re-run all the code up to HERE":  

In an R script, use <br />[Ctrl/Command] + [Alt/Option] + B 

In R markdown, use <br />[Ctrl/Command] + [Alt/Option] + P 

If you run R from the shell, use Ctrl+D or q() to quit, then restart R.

## Avoid `rm(list = ls())`

This is highly *suggestive* of a non-reproducible workflow.

<br />
This line is meant to reset things, either to power-cycle the current analysis or to switch from one project to another. But there are better ways to do both:

- To power-cycle the current analysis, restart R!  

- To switch from one project to another, either restart R or, even better, use an IDE with proper support for projects, where each project gets its own R process.

<br />
#### The problem with `rm(list = ls())` is that, given the intent, it does not go far enough.

???
It’s fairly common to see data analysis scripts that begin with this object-nuking command:

This is highly suggestive of a non-reproducible workflow.

### LPT: Do this as you go, not "tomorrow"

## Workflow vs. Product

**Workflow** = the things you do because of personal taste and habits 

- The editor you use to write your R code.  

- The name of your home directory.  

- The R code you ran before lunch.  

**Product** = the logic and output that is the essence of your project 

- The raw data.

- The R code someone needs to run on your raw data to get your results, including the explicit `library()` calls to load necessary packages.  

<br />

#### Ideally, you don’t hardwire anything about your workflow into your product. 

???

Workflow-related operations should be executed by you interactively, using whatever means is appropriate to your setup, but not built into the scripts themselves.

### `setwd("path/that/only/works/on/my/machine")`
The chance of the `setwd()` command having the desired effect – making the file paths work – for anyone besides its author is 0%. 

It’s also unlikely to work for the author one or two years or computers from now.]

???
## Dilemma and solution

**The Dilemma:**

We want to work on project A with R’s working directory set to path/to/projectA and on project B with R’s working directory set to path/to/projectB.


But we also want to keep code like `setwd("path/to/projectA")` out of our .R scripts.


**Solutions:**

Set the working directory yourself, interactively, at the same time as you restart R, when you switch from project A to project B. 

Use an IDE that supports a project-based workflow. This eliminates the tension between your development convenience and the portability of the code.


---
## Adopt a project-oriented workflow

**Project**= a folder on your computer that holds all the files relevant to that particular piece of work

**Project-oriented workflow**= a file system discipline

- All paths are relative — relative to the project's folder  

- Eliminates the tension between your development convenience and the portability of the code.

???
This convention guarantees that the project can be moved around on your computer or onto other computers and will still “just work”.

## RStudio Projects

The RStudio IDE (capital "P") Project  
- a very effective implementation of the (small "p") projects.

#### Why?

`r emo_up` They are the same “unit” as a GitHub repo!

`r emo_up` You can have multiple Projects going at once!

# Practice Safe Paths

---
## Tips to avoid `setwd()`

#### The `fs` package

- filepath handling

#### The `here()` package

- project-relative paths  

- identifies your project's files, based on the current working directory at the time when the package is loaded.

## Create a stable base

# Naming Conventions

---
## 3 Principles

1. Machine readable
2. Human readable 
3. Plays well with default ordering

---
## Break logic & output into pieces

---
## Staying organized

.pull-left[
`r emo_up` self-explaining  

<br />
`r emo_up`  
<br />  
`r emo_up`   

]

.pull-right[
`r emo_down` wordy, needy explainers  

<br />
`r emo_down`   

<br />
`r emo_down`   

]

<!--
<br /><br />

#### The more **deliberate** you are about where things live, <br /> the **easier** it will be for you & future you, <br /> the **easier** it will be for other people, <br /> the **easier** it will be for other computers.

# Reprex

---
## Make a reprex in 2 steps

#### 1. Make your code reproducible

- Make sure you capture everything

  - i.e., include any library() calls and create all necessary objects  

- This can be done with the `reprex` package

#### 2. Make it minimal

- Strip away everything that is not directly related to your problem

- Create a much smaller and simpler R object than the one you’re facing in real life 

  - consider using built-in data


---
## The `reprex` package

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```

Write a bit of code and copy it to the clipboard:

Enter `reprex()` in the R Console. In RStudio, you’ll see a preview of your rendered reprex.

It is now ready and waiting on your clipboard, so you can paste it into, say, a GitHub issue.

If your code is not self-contained, running `reprex()` results in an error.
