# Preparation

The thought is that we will have four weekly "assignments" in the runup to the unconf itself.

We want to do this to give everyone a chance to arrive at the unconf in roughly the same shape, confident to get started.

The current thought for the weekly assignments are:

- Week 0: RStudio and GitHub
- Week 1: R and git
- Week 2: Rtools, devtools, and usethis (oh my)
- Week 3: Github PAT and checkover

Each "week" will have an entry on a page at the main Unconf site. Each week will also have a screencast demonstrating the tasks. 

The purpose of this part of the repository is for me to collect my thoughts, and to make xaringan presentations to use within the screencasts.
