# R and git

Our goal is for everyone's computer to have a "sufficiently-current" version of R and access to git.

Accordingly, we are encouraging folks to have a version of R >= 3.4, and to have git accessible from the command-line.

As usual, we refer to Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git With R](https://happygitwithr.com) for both [R installation](https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html) and [git installation](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html).

When ready, we will have links to the slides for for this week's topics for [macOS](#) and [Windows](#).
