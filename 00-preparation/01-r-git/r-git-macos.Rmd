# Why are we doing this?

--

### We want all of our computers to be ready to collaborate

--

### Package-development tools work best using recent versions of R

--

### To move code to/from GitHub, we need git

---

# Goals for this week

### R

- what version do you have? In the **R console** pane:

```r
R.version.string
```

--

```
## [1] "R version 3.5.3 (2019-03-22)"
```

- if you have R 3.5.3, **you're done!** 

--

- if not at least 3.4, update (you might want to update anyway)
  - if you update more than a minor version, e.g. 3.4 -> 3.5, you have to reinstall your R packages

--
  
- To install:
  - go to [this CRAN page](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
  - follow the *Download and Install R* link for macOS

---

# Goals for this week

### git installation

- do you have git installed? In the **Terminal** pane:

```
git --version
```

--

```
git version 2.17.2 (Apple Git-113)
```

- if you get a response like this, **you're done!**

--

- if you do not get a response like this, your computer may offer to install *developer command-line tools*

  - we suggest you accept the offer
  - for our purposes you need only the command-line tools, (**not all of Xcode**)
